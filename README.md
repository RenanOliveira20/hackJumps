# Hack Jumps 
## Project IronHack
 
  Hello!! 
  You ready to play my first game? Come on! 

  First I will introduce my game to you. 
  My game was inspired by Doodle Jump game, this game I played a lot in my childhood, so it became more enjoyable to make my game.

  Well let's go through the character at first, my character is a malware that has the objective of stealing the Labs of his classmates, but for that he'll have to go up and look for the best place to carry out his attack. Getting closer to your goal the harder it will be, so be careful not to get careless and end up losing everything he built. <br>
